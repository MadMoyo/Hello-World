# Hello-World
Noob
I'm super new to this world. Iam a recording artist and business entrepreneur who wants to create a website and an app and business all at the same time. im doing the beat i can while fighting against my former friend and boss who seems to think it funny to attack my accounts and phone some how and messing around with things to delay my success. That's what's new with me. im a father and have a gf and live a normal enough life that sometimes seems to bleeds drama around random corners.
